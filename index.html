            <p>i wanted to do a lot of things. i decided the day i might not be able to change much in my life, what i called my end day. i was still inside, quarantining from a possible variant of a deadly virus but mostly <strong><em>self-isolating</em></strong> because i did not want to make excuses to hide from people.</p>
            <p>but i was making myself busy. i was coding, i was writing, i was drawing, i was thinking. trying to think less about my future, and more about <em>the moment</em> than anything else.</p>
